  How political support reduces the effect of government performance on
  citizens’ political trust
---
Public attitude surveys have recorded declining level of political trust across a number of western democracies . But while this suggests that citizens are increasingly unlikely to trust their governments, little is known about what is driving the decline in these reported levels of trust. Given the important role trust plays in representative democracies – without the trust of their citizens, a government and its institutions may be undermined, destabilised or paralysed to inaction  – it is important to understand what drives citizens’ political trust, and what impact this has on the workings of democracy.

As an academic concept, political trust is seen as an assessment of the functioning of the institutions of government, not an assessment of the aims or policies of the political party in charge of them . And while, at the macro level, key indicators of governments’ performance are correlated with their citizens’ level of political trust, economic and political ‘winners’ in society tend to report higher levels of political trust, even within countries. In fact political factors appear to be the biggest drivers of individuals’ political trust; people who support the political party in charge of their government consistently report higher political trust than other citizens. 

This is evident when comparing the levels of political trust amongst French respondents to the European Social Survey (ESS) during a time when there was a change in the party in charge of government. As the first plot in the figure below shows, political trust amongst French citizens was consistently higher for those who reported having voting for the Prime Minister’s party in the previous election than those who did not. But given the change in government in 2012, the two groups (supporters of the Prime Minister’s party and others) actually refer to two difference sets of people; before 2012, this group is made up of supporters of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) who won the 2002 and 2007 legislative elections. From 2012 it is made up of supporters of the Parti Socialiste (PS) who won the 2012 elections. Across this whole period, supporters of the governing party report higher political trust than supporters of an opposition party but the pattern of decline in trust is similar across both groups. The second plot shows how political trust actually changes markedly when a new government is elected; before 2012, citizens who voted for the UMP who ran the government had significantly higher trust than those who had voted for the PS. After 2012, when the PS defeated the UMP, this was reversed. Similar patterns are evident in other member states:

Data: European Social Survey, waves 2-7



This suggests there is a clear partisan component to political trust. But is this because government supports see a “winners’ bonus” in their level of political trust or do they interpret government performance differently?

To investigate this, data on key performance indicators for governments across Europe can be combined with individual level data about their citizens’ political attitudes. Using this combined dataset, we can build multi-level models that allow us to estimate the effect of both individual and country level characteristics on individuals’ level of political trust. Using individual data from waves 2 to 7 of the European Social Survey, a battery of survey items relating to respondents’ trust in their national parliament, politicians and political parties are combined to construct an additive scale to reflect the underlying (latent) concept of political trust . Other individual level data (including measuring respondents’ demographics, socio-economic situation and political attitudes) are also included from the ESS.

Given that political trust is highly correlated with citizens’ support for the party in charge of government and their view of how well government performs, only external measures of government performance are included in this model to investigate the relationship between government performance and political trust. Although government performance has several components, only two are used here: the way in which government operates (here called ‘procedural fairness) and the economic outputs it produces. Corruption (measured through Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index), political rights (measured by Freedom House) and the wastefulness of government spending (from the World Economic Forum’s Executive Opinion Survey) reflect a single component of procedural fairness and that economic inequality (measured through Eurostat’s GINI index) along with the World Bank’s measures of change in national employment rates and GDP reflect a second component of economic outputs .

Using multi-level models (to capture within country and over-time variance in our data), we can investigate the relationship between these government performance indicators and citizens’ levels of political trust. This model shows that procedural fairness, in particular, appears to have a substantial effect on political trust. An increase of one standard deviation in the difference in procedural quality causes an estimated increase in political trust of 0.341 points, on a scale of 0 to 10. This is greater than the effect of having voted for the winning party, rather than any other party, in the previous general election. However, the effect of the difference in economic outputs is much smaller.

But this model assumes that the effect of government performance on levels of political trust is homogenous across all citizens. Given the powerful effect of political support and partisanship to influence citizens’ views of government performance, this is unlikely to be the case. Therefore, we can construct and additional model which allows the effect of government performance to vary by both the strength and direction of citizens’ partisanship. Respondents to each wave of the ESS are categorised into four separate groups : 

1.	Those who voted for the party of the Prime Minister and consider themselves close to this party;

2.	Those who voted for the party of the Prime Minister but do not consider themselves close to this party;

3.	Those who did not vote for the party of the Prime Minister and consider themselves close to the party for whom they voted;

4.	Those who did not vote for the party of the Prime Minister but do not consider themselves close to the party for whom they voted.

In this model we can see that the effect of government performance on political trust does differ between these groups. Procedural quality has a significant, positive effect on the levels of political of all groups apart from those who did not vote for the party of the Prime Minister and consider themselves close to the party for whom they voted. Economic outputs have a significant, albeit smaller, positive effect on the levels of political trust on all groups apart from those who voted for and consider themselves close to the party of the Prime Minister.

Looking at predicted levels of political trust generated from this in the figure below, we can see that levels of political trust do tend to increase for most groups as government performance improves. People who voted for the Prime Minister’s party and who consider themselves close to this party also consistently report the highest level of political trust, no matter the quality of government performance. However individuals who do not consider themselves very close to a political party report similar levels of political trust across different levels of government performance, no matter if they voted for the Prime Minister’s party or for another party in the previous General Election. This suggests that a “winners’ bonus” in political trust for supporters of an incumbent government is not as evident for those who do not consider themselves close to a political party as for those who do:

Therefore, even when the effects of procedural quality and economic performance are allowed to vary by the direction and strength of individuals’ partisanship, the difference in political trust between individuals depending on the direction and strength of their partisanship persists. This suggests that while proximity to, and support for, a party influences how they react to government performance, this does not capture the entirety of the difference. Therefore, it appears that a “winner’s bonus” in political trust continues, particularly for close supporters of the party in charge of government. 

This means that any attempts to increase citizens’ level of political trust by improving government performance alone (at least in terms of procedural quality and economic outputs) are unlikely to be sufficient. Citizens’ own political attitudes shape their perceptions of government performance and appear to moderate the impact of external measure of performance on their own levels of political trust and people who are close to political parties appear somewhat blinded to different aspects of government performance as they determine their level of political trust.
