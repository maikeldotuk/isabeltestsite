  title: Numbers matter
  description: >+
    The world is a frustratingly complicated place. Even without starting to try
    to understand the great scientific or philosophical questions of our time,
    we can see that things are not straightforward. Especially when we want
    different people from diverse groups and backgrounds to live together as a
    harmonious society. And even more so if we want that society to ensure that
    all its members are sufficiently looked after; if we want them to have an
    acceptable standard of living, healthcare and education. 


    There are, unfortunately, plenty of people who are willing to line up to
    promise simple solutions to complex problems. Who are happy to point the
    figure of blame in a direction that suits them and dismiss arguments they
    find inconvenient. And while that might allow them to feel good about
    themselves, it is unlikely to help anyone who really needs it.


    I may be hopelessly naive on the matter, but I've always thought that
    evidence might actually be a better place to start. That we might want to
    find out what is really happening in the world before we diagnose and
    attempt to treat the problems we see. And there's a lot of data out there
    that can help us. Data about how people live their lives, how they interact
    with each other and the governments that represent them, and how they
    perceive the world around them. Data that is often unused or underused to
    help us make sense of the complicated world around us.

  This is therefore my attempt to use little bits of data to piece together my
  thoughts on the issues that are important to me

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...
